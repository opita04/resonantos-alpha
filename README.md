## What is ResonantOS?

ResonantOS is an **experience layer** that runs on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Think of it like macOS to Unix — OpenClaw is the kernel, ResonantOS adds the intelligence.

It gives your AI collaborator:

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🧠 **R-Memory** | Conversation compression — your AI remembers everything, forever |
| 🎯 **R-Awareness** | Contextual knowledge injection — the right docs at the right time |
| 📊 **Dashboard** | Mission Control at `localhost:19100` |
| 💰 **Symbiotic Wallet** | Three-wallet Solana architecture (Human + AI + Symbiotic PDA) |
| 🏛️ **DAO** | Resonant Chamber — on-chain governance and community treasury |
| 🪙 **Token Economy** | $RCT (soulbound governance) + $RES (transferable currency) + REX sub-tokens |
| 🛒 **Protocol Store** | Buy, sell, and trade AI protocol NFTs on-chain |
| 🛡️ **Shield** | File protection & security governance *(in development)* |
| ⚖️ **Logician** | Cost & policy validation *(spec phase)* |
| 🔄 **Guardian** | Self-healing & incident recovery *(in development)* |

## ✨ Philosophy

### Augmentatism
> *"As artificial intelligence generates infinite content, the most human thing we can do is make meaning together."*

A social contract between human and AI. The human is sovereign — the AI amplifies, never replaces. We build **with** AI, not **under** it. [Read more →](https://augmentatism.com)

<details>
<summary><strong>What the installer does</strong></summary>

1. Checks dependencies (Node 18+, Python 3, Git, OpenClaw)
2. Clones this repo to `~/resonantos-alpha/`
3. Installs R-Memory & R-Awareness extensions into OpenClaw
4. Sets up the SSoT template structure (L0–L4)
5. Configures keyword triggers for contextual injection
6. Installs the Dashboard and its dependencies

</details>

**After install:**

```bash
openclaw gateway start                                    # 1. Start OpenClaw
cd ~/resonantos-alpha/dashboard && python3 server_v2.py   # 2. Launch Dashboard
open http://localhost:19100                                # 3. Open Mission Control
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Fresh Installation

The installer creates workspace templates (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`) that teach your AI how to operate. To get the most out of the system:

1. **Gather your documents** — business plan, project briefs, values statement, anything that defines your work. Put them in a single folder (e.g., `~/Desktop/my-docs/`).
2. **Tell your AI:** *"Read everything in ~/Desktop/my-docs/ and use it to fill in my SOUL.md, USER.md, and MEMORY.md."*
3. Your AI will extract your values, communication style, project context, and preferences into the right files.

### Existing Installation

If you already have OpenClaw running with your own workspace files:

1. Tell your AI where your existing documents live.
2. Ask it to review them and populate the ResonantOS workspace templates with relevant context.
3. Your existing files won't be overwritten — the installer only creates templates for files that don't exist yet.

### The Memory System

Your AI maintains two layers of memory:

| Layer | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Daily logs** | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Raw session notes: decisions, lessons, mistakes, open items |
| **Long-term** | `MEMORY.md` | Curated insights distilled from daily logs |

Daily logs follow a structured format that captures not just *what* happened, but *what was learned* — including mistakes and whether they can be prevented by rules. OpenClaw's built-in `memory_search` automatically indexes all memory files, making them searchable via RAG across sessions.

### Self-Improvement Loop

ResonantOS includes a self-improvement protocol where your AI learns from its own mistakes:

1. **First occurrence** of a mistake is tracked in the daily log
2. **Second occurrence** (pattern detected) triggers evaluation: can this be prevented mechanically?
3. **If enforceable**, a Logician rule is created — starting in advisory mode, then graduating to enforcement
4. **If not enforceable**, it becomes a permanent lesson in `MEMORY.md`

This means your AI gets better over time without you having to micromanage it. Mistakes become rules. Rules become guarantees.

## 🧠 R-Memory — Infinite Conversations

Your AI's conversations compress in the background, so context never runs out.

**Three-phase pipeline:**

| Phase | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **1. Background Compression** | Every turn | Groups messages → compresses via Haiku → caches to disk |
| **2. Compaction Swap** | 36K tokens | Replaces oldest raw blocks with cached compressed versions |
| **3. FIFO Eviction** | 80K tokens | Evicts oldest compressed blocks (preserved on disk) |

**Result:** 75–92% token savings. Conversations run indefinitely with minimal information loss.

---

## 🎯 R-Awareness — Contextual Intelligence

Your AI loads the right knowledge at the right time, based on what you're talking about.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Cold Start** | ~120 tokens (identity only) — not 1600+ |
| **Keyword Triggers** | Mention "philosophy" → loads philosophy docs automatically |
| **TTL Management** | Docs stay for 15 turns, then unload |
| **Manual Control** | `/R load`, `/R remove`, `/R list`, `/R pause` |
| **Token Budget** | Max 15K tokens, 10 docs per turn |

---

## 📚 SSoT — Single Source of Truth

Knowledge is organized in layers, from permanent truths to working notes:

| Layer | Purpose | Examples |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **L0** | Foundation | Philosophy, manifesto, constitution |
| **L1** | Architecture | System specs, component design |
| **L2** | Active Projects | Current work, milestones |
| **L3** | Drafts | Ideas, proposals in progress |
| **L4** | Notes | Session logs, raw captures |

Higher layers are stable; lower layers change frequently. Your AI knows the difference.

---

## 📊 Dashboard

The Dashboard runs at `localhost:19100` — everything stays on your machine.

| Page | What You'll Find |
|------|-----------------|
| **Overview** | System health, agent status, activity feed |
| **R-Memory** | SSoT document manager, keyword config, file locking |
| **Wallet** | Solana DevNet integration (DAO, tokens, onboarding) |
| **Agents** | Agent management and skills |
| **Projects** | Project tracking, TODO, Ideas |

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### `dashboard/config.json`
Solana RPC endpoints, token mints, safety caps. Copy from `config.example.json` and fill in your values.

### `r-awareness/keywords.json`
Maps keywords to SSoT documents. When you say a keyword, the matching doc loads into your AI's context.

### `r-memory/config.json`
Compression triggers, block size, eviction thresholds. Defaults work well — tune if needed.

---

## 🛡️ Security

- **File Locking** — Critical docs protected via OS-level immutable flags (`chflags uchg`)
- **Sanitization Auditor** — `tools/sanitize-audit.py` scans for leaked secrets before any public release
- **Local-First** — No cloud dependencies. Your data stays on your machine.
- **Shield** — Permission validation and sandboxing *(in development)*
